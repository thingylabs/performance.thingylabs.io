### 1. Welcome to Our Health Campaign

Dear Colleagues,  

At Thingylabs GmbH, we are committed to providing you with an optimal working environment where you can achieve peak performance. Our new health campaign, “Peak Performance through Health,” aims to enhance your health, focus, and productivity in our demanding high-performance environment. This initiative reflects our dedication to your well-being and the sustainable growth of our company.

With this Information and Consent Form, we aim to inform you comprehensively about the campaign and obtain your voluntary consent to participate. Your data and privacy are of the highest priority—we strictly adhere to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), particularly Articles 6, 7, 13, and 15–21.

### 2. Purpose and Content of the Campaign

#### 2.1 Goal of the Campaign
Our “Peak Performance through Health” campaign seeks to improve your health and performance in the workplace, especially in our high-performance environment, characterized by intensive software development, tight deadlines, and high cognitive demands. Specific goals include:

- Improving sleep quality by providing Melatonin (0.5 mg).
- Enhancing cognitive health and focus through Omega-3 concentrate (750 mg).
- Reducing sick days and boosting productivity through targeted health measures.

#### 2.2 Approach
- **Supplements**: You will receive free Melatonin tablets (0.5 mg) and Omega-3 concentrate (750 mg), which you can take daily to support sleep and cognition. Taking the supplements is voluntary and at your own responsibility.
- **Surveys**: Before and after the campaign (after 6 months), we ask you to complete anonymous surveys about your sleep quality, focus, sick days, and productivity. These data will help us evaluate the effectiveness of the measures and justify the costs tax-deductible as advertising expenses (Article 6(1)(f) GDPR – legitimate interest).
- **Documentation**: Your participation will be documented (e.g., by confirming receipt of supplements), but no personal data will be made public.
