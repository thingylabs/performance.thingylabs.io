## Overview
We process data in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the Thingylabs Performance Initiative, which includes targeted health measures to enhance employee health, focus, and productivity.

## Pseudonymous Data Collection
The Thingylabs Performance Initiative uses a pseudonymous approach to data collection:

- **Participant Codes**: You create a unique code (e.g., TL-202311-123) that you use across all surveys
- **No Direct Identification**: We do not collect names, email addresses, or other directly identifying information
- **Linking Data**: Your participant code allows us to link your responses across multiple surveys without knowing your identity
- **Data Security**: All data is stored on encrypted servers in compliance with Article 32 GDPR

## Legal Basis for Processing
- **Consent**: Participation is voluntary, and your completion of surveys with your participant code constitutes consent under Article 6(1)(a) GDPR
- **Legitimate Interest**: We improve workplace performance and well-being under Article 6(1)(f) GDPR
- **Scientific Research**: Data is also processed for scientific research purposes in the field of nutritional and physical health strategies under Article 89 GDPR

## Your Rights Under GDPR
- **Access**: Request access to your data by providing your participant code
- **Rectification**: Correct inaccurate data by referencing your participant code
- **Erasure**: Request deletion of your data ("right to be forgotten")
- **Restriction**: Limit how we use your data
- **Objection**: Object to our processing of your data
- **Data Portability**: Receive your data in a structured, commonly used format

To exercise any of these rights, please contact [performance@thingylabs.io](mailto:performance@thingylabs.io) with your participant code.

## Data Retention
- All data is retained for 12 months after the study concludes for analysis purposes
- After this period, the data will either be fully anonymized (by removing participant codes) or deleted
- You may request earlier deletion of your data by contacting us with your participant code

## Special Categories of Data
- The study collects information related to health and well-being, which may constitute special category data under Article 9 GDPR
- This processing is permitted based on your explicit consent and for scientific research purposes with appropriate safeguards

## Data Sharing
- Aggregated, anonymized results may be shared in scientific publications or presentations
- Individual-level pseudonymous data is never shared with third parties
- No data is transferred outside the European Economic Area (EEA)
