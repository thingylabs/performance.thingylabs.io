![Thingylabs GmbH Logo](https://www.thingylabs.io/logo-with-text.png)

Welcome to the *Thingylabs Performance Initiative* repository, which supports our health campaign, “Peak Performance through Health at Thingylabs GmbH,” and related outreach efforts to promote our high-performance, innovative software and cloud development environment.

## Purpose
This initiative aims to enhance employee health, focus, and productivity through targeted measures (e.g., Melatonin 0.5 mg, Omega-3 750 mg) while positioning Thingylabs GmbH as a leader in the tech community. It includes:
- An Information and Consent Form for employee participation (anonymous and PII-free).
- Anonymous surveys to evaluate campaign effectiveness.
- Branding assets and outreach materials for external stakeholders.

This initiative is being developed into a proprietary commercial product for licensing or consulting services to other tech companies. For commercial inquiries or premium services, contact [performance@thingylabs.io](mailto:performance@thingylabs.io).
