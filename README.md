Welcome to the *Thingylabs Performance Initiative* repository, supporting our scientific campaign, "Peak Performance through Health at Thingylabs GmbH," and related outreach efforts to promote our high-performance, innovative software and cloud development environment through nutritional and physical health strategies.

## Overview

This repository provides straightforward resources for our scientific study, including:

- Study outlines, protocols, and simple participant guides.
- Surveys for collecting data with weekly printable sheets.
- GDPR-compliant data collection using pseudonymous participant codes.

Explore these directories for what you need:

- **`docs/`**: Study plans and participant instructions.
- **`surveys/`**: Weekly tracking sheets and surveys.

## Next Steps for Facilitators

- Check the study plans and guides in `docs/` to get started.
- Review the [GDPR Compliance](https://thingylabs.github.io/thingylabs-performance-initiative/gdpr-compliance) page to understand our data protection approach.
- Share the participant guides from `docs/` with your group.
- Ensure each participant creates their unique participant code (e.g., TL-202311-123).
- Hand out the daily tracking sheets from `surveys/` for participants to log each day over the week.
- Collect completed sheets at the end of each week, ensuring participant codes are used instead of names.

## Data Protection

We take data protection seriously. Our approach includes:
- Pseudonymous data collection using participant codes
- No collection of directly identifying information
- Secure storage on encrypted servers
- Clear processes for participants to exercise their GDPR rights
