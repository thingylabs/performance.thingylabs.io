## Purpose
This initiative, owned by D3velop Ltd (In Gründung) in Seychelles and licensed to Thingylabs GmbH, aims to enhance employee physiological and psychological well-being, cognitive performance, and workplace productivity through evidence-based nutritional and physical health strategies (e.g., energy availability, macronutrient balance, ergogenic aids, recovery optimization) while positioning Thingylabs GmbH as a leader in the tech community. It includes scientific surveys, numbered study outlines (e.g., study-1-outline, study-2-outline, with sub-numbers like study-1.1-outline), numbered protocols (e.g., study-1-protocol, study-2-protocol, with sub-numbers like study-1.1-protocol), simple protocols (e.g., study-1-simple-protocol), consent forms, branding assets, and outreach materials to advance research and promote our mission.

This initiative is being developed into a proprietary commercial product for licensing or consulting services to other tech companies. For commercial inquiries or premium services, contact [performance@thingylabs.io](mailto:performance@thingylabs.io).
