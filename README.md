- A dual-use Information and Consent Form for employee participation (anonymous and non-anonymous, PII-free in this repository).
- Dual-use survey templates for anonymous and non-anonymous feedback to evaluate campaign effectiveness.
- Branding assets and outreach materials for external stakeholders.

This initiative is being developed into a proprietary commercial product for licensing or consulting services to other tech companies. For commercial inquiries or premium services, contact [performance@thingylabs.io](mailto:performance@thingylabs.io).
