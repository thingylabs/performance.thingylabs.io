## Survey Questions
### Section 1: Nutritional and Physical Health (Hypothesis: Ergogenic Aids and Energy Availability Improve Well-being)
<table>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">
      <strong>1. On a scale of 1 to 5, how would you rate your overall physiological and psychological well-being since adopting the initiative's nutritional and physical health strategies (e.g., energy availability, recovery optimization)?</strong>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2" class="print-options">
      Circle one: &nbsp;&nbsp; 1 - Very Poor &nbsp;&nbsp; 2 - Poor &nbsp;&nbsp; 3 - Neutral &nbsp;&nbsp; 4 - Good &nbsp;&nbsp; 5 - Excellent
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2" class="note">
      <em>(This quantifiable metric, using terms like "energy availability" and "recovery optimization," tests the hypothesis that nutritional strategies enhance well-being, per Sports Nutrition standards—Web:1.)</em>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">
      <strong>2. Have you experienced measurable improvements in your energy availability or recovery capacity (e.g., reduced fatigue, enhanced recovery)?</strong>
    </td>

    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2" class="note">

</table>

### Section 2: Cognitive Performance and Productivity (Hypothesis: Nutritional Strategies Boost Performance)
<table>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">
      <strong>3. On a scale of 1 to 5, how has the initiative's focus on nutritional strategies (e.g., macronutrient balance, ergogenic aids) influenced your daily work productivity?</strong>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2" class="print-options">
      Circle one: &nbsp;&nbsp; 1 - Significantly Decreased &nbsp;&nbsp; 2 - Slightly Decreased &nbsp;&nbsp; 3 - No Change &nbsp;&nbsp; 4 - Slightly Increased &nbsp;&nbsp; 5 - Significantly Increased

### Section 3: Scientific Feedback (Hypothesis: Specific Strategies Are Effective)
<table>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">
      <strong>5. Which nutritional or physical health strategies (e.g., macronutrient balance, ergogenic aids, recovery optimization) do you believe most contributed to any observed improvements in your well-being or productivity?</strong>
    </td>
