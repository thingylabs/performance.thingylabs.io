# Study 1 Entry Survey

## Instructions for Use
This survey is the initial data collection (Survey #1) for our scientific study on how nutritional and physical health strategies (e.g., ergogenic aids, energy availability, recovery optimization) influence employee health, cognitive performance, and workplace productivity at Thingylabs GmbH. It can be conducted as either **anonymous** or **non-anonymous**, depending on your needs. Follow the steps below to customize it for your team.

### For Anonymous Surveys
1. Remove or skip the **Consent Statement** and **PII Questions** sections.
2. Ensure no personally identifying information (PII) is collected.
3. Share the survey link with participants.

### For Non-Anonymous Surveys
1. Include the **Consent Statement** and **PII Questions** sections.
2. Ensure participants provide explicit consent for PII collection.
3. Store PII securely and process it in compliance with GDPR.

## Survey Questions
### Section 1: Nutritional and Physical Health (Hypothesis: Ergogenic Aids and Energy Availability Improve Well-being)
1. **On a scale of 1 to 5, how would you rate your overall physiological and psychological well-being since adopting the initiative’s nutritional and physical health strategies (e.g., energy availability, recovery optimization)?**  
   [Scale 1–5: 1 = Very Poor, 5 = Excellent]  
   *(This quantifiable metric, using terms like “energy availability” and “recovery optimization,” tests the hypothesis that nutritional strategies enhance well-being, per Sports Nutrition standards—Web:1.)*

2. **Have you experienced measurable improvements in your energy availability or recovery capacity (e.g., reduced fatigue, enhanced recovery)?**  
   [Yes/No; If Yes, briefly describe in 50 characters or less]  
   *(This binary question, with a concise qualitative follow-up, uses “energy availability” and “recovery capacity” to assess nutritional impact scientifically, feasible within time constraints—Web:0.)*

### Section 2: Cognitive Performance and Productivity (Hypothesis: Nutritional Strategies Boost Performance)
3. **On a scale of 1 to 5, how has the initiative’s focus on nutritional strategies (e.g., macronutrient balance, ergogenic aids) influenced your daily work productivity?**  
   [Scale 1–5: 1 = Significantly Decreased, 5 = Significantly Increased]  
   *(This quantifiable metric, using “macronutrient balance” and “ergogenic aids,” tests the hypothesis that nutritional strategies enhance productivity, per Sports Nutrition—Web:1.)*

4. **Have you noticed a consistent enhancement in your cognitive performance or mental alertness during work hours due to these strategies?**  
   [Yes/No; If Yes, briefly describe in 50 characters or less]  
   *(This binary question, with a concise qualitative follow-up, uses “cognitive performance” and “mental alertness” to assess scientific impact, aligned with Sports Sciences—Web:3.)*

### Section 3: Scientific Feedback (Hypothesis: Specific Strategies Are Effective)
5. **Which nutritional or physical health strategies (e.g., macronutrient balance, ergogenic aids, recovery optimization) do you believe most contributed to any observed improvements in your well-being or productivity?**  
   [Text Area, max 150 characters]  
   *(This concise qualitative question, using field-specific terms, gathers insights for hypothesis refinement, maintaining scientific rigor within time limits—Web:0.)*
