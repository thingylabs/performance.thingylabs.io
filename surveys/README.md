# Surveys

## Overview
Surveys are a key component of the Thingylabs Performance Initiative. This repository provides a **dual-use survey template** that can be adapted for both **anonymous** and **non-anonymous** surveys to evaluate the impact of targeted health measures on employee health, focus, and productivity.

## Template
- [Dual-Use Survey Template](./survey-template.md)

## Instructions

### For Non-Anonymous Surveys
