## Purpose
This initiative, owned by D3velop Ltd (In Gründung) in Seychelles and licensed to Thingylabs GmbH, aims to enhance employee physiological and psychological well-being, cognitive performance, and workplace productivity through evidence-based nutritional and physical health strategies (e.g., energy availability, macronutrient balance, ergogenic aids, recovery optimization) while positioning Thingylabs GmbH as a leader in the tech community. It includes scientific surveys, study outlines, protocols, participant guides, consent forms, and more to advance research and promote our mission.

This initiative is being developed into a proprietary commercial product for licensing or consulting services to other tech companies. For commercial inquiries or premium services, contact [performance@thingylabs.io](mailto:performance@thingylabs.io).

- No collection of directly identifying information
- Secure storage on encrypted servers
- Clear processes for participants to exercise their GDPR rights

## GDPR Compliance
We process data in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). All data collection is pseudonymous, using participant codes rather than directly identifying information.
