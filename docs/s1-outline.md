# Thingylabs Performance Initiative Study 1 Outline

## Overview
This outline (Outline for Study #1) outlines the scientific investigation of nutritional and physical health strategies to enhance employee physiological and psychological well-being, cognitive performance, and workplace productivity at Thingylabs GmbH. The initiative, owned by D3velop Ltd (In Gründung) in Seychelles and licensed to Thingylabs GmbH, aims to advance evidence-based practices in Sports and Nutritional Sciences for workplace settings, with plans for additional outlines (e.g., Study 2 Outline, Study 1.1 Outline).

## Study Objectives
- Evaluate the impact of nutritional and physical health strategies on employee health, cognitive performance, and productivity.
- Test hypotheses linking specific strategies to measurable outcomes, contributing to scientific knowledge and potential commercial applications.

## Substances/Strategies to Test
We provide the following generic, non-proprietary nutritional and physical health substances/strategies, aligned with Sports and Nutritional Sciences, for employees to use at their discretion:
- **Omega-3 (e.g., Fish Oil Concentrate Softgels)**: Supports energy availability and recovery, with employees choosing intake (less or more than packaging), urged to follow packaging (e.g., Precision Nutrition recommends 3–9 g daily total fish oil, 1–3 g EPA + DHA; see [Precision Nutrition](https://www.precisionnutrition.com/all-about-fish-oil#:~:text=Summary%20and%20recommendations,(e.g.%20herring%2C%20mackerel))) but with choice.
- **Vitamin D3 + K2 (e.g., High-Dose Vegetarian Tablets)**: Enhances recovery and well-being, with employee discretion on intake, urged to follow packaging but with choice.
- **Green Tea Extract (e.g., Capsules with EGCG and Caffeine)**: Supports ergogenic aids and cognitive performance, with employees deciding amounts, urged to follow packaging but with choice.
- **Anthocyanins (e.g., Blueberry Extract Capsules)**: Boosts recovery and well-being, with employee choice on intake, urged to follow packaging but with choice.
- **Melatonin (e.g., Low-Dose Tablets)**: Aids recovery and sleep, with employees choosing amounts, urged to follow packaging (e.g., 0.5 mg per 1/2 tablet) but with choice.

These are generic, ensuring compliance with Germany/EU and Seychelles health regulations, without specific dosages or proprietary products.

## Study Design
- **Type**: Observational cohort study with anonymous and non-anonymous data collection, conducted over 12 months.
- **Participants**: Thingylabs GmbH employees (n=2 initially, with potential expansion), voluntarily participating under informed consent (GDPR-compliant).
- **Data Collection**:
  - Use a weekly printable sheet (`study-1-simple-protocol.md`) for daily tracking of substance use (Monday–Sunday) and end-of-week questions on well-being, energy/recovery, productivity, cognitive performance, and sleep.
  - Employees print the sheet weekly, fill out daily for substances, and complete end-of-week questions on Sunday, using yes/no or 1–5 scales with qualitative feedback (50 chars max).
- **Duration**: Initial data collection over 3 months, with follow-ups every 3 months, totaling 12 months.
- **Analysis**: Basic statistical analysis (e.g., mean scores, t-tests) for quantitative data and thematic coding for qualitative data, feasible for a small team within time constraints (Web:2).
- **Exit/Abort Conditions**:
  - Participant withdrawal (voluntary or request).
  - Adverse reactions to substances (e.g., allergies, severe side effects).
  - Data quality issues (incomplete, illegible, or unreliable weekly sheets).
  - Regulatory non-compliance (Germany/EU, Seychelles, or GDPR breaches).
  - Safety concerns (new evidence or regulatory changes indicating risks).
  - Study completion (12-month period ends).

## Hypotheses
1. **H1**: Nutritional strategies (e.g., Omega-3, Vitamin D3 + K2, anthocyanins) enhancing energy availability and recovery optimization will significantly improve physiological and psychological well-being (measured via self-reported scales and binary responses).
2. **H2**: Ergogenic aids (e.g., green tea extract) and macronutrient balance (e.g., Omega-3) will significantly enhance cognitive performance and workplace productivity (measured via self-reported scales and binary responses).
3. **H3**: Specific nutritional and physical health strategies (e.g., Omega-3, melatonin) will be identified as primary contributors to observed improvements, based on qualitative feedback.

## Ethical Considerations
- **GDPR Compliance**: Data collection is anonymous by default, with optional non-anonymous participation requiring explicit consent. PII is handled securely, stored separately, and deleted 12 months post-study unless otherwise agreed (Web:0).
- **Health Regulations**: Avoid specific dosages or proprietary substances, focusing on generic strategies to comply with German/EU health laws and scientific ethics (Web:3).
- **Informed Consent**: Participants receive clear information on study purpose, voluntary participation, data use, and exit/abort conditions, per GDPR and ethical standards (Web:1).
- **Exit/Abort Actions**: Suspend participation, notify employees, consult experts (e.g., medical, legal), ensure GDPR compliance (e.g., data deletion), and document reasons for termination or suspension.

## Limitations
- Small sample size (n=2 initially) limits generalizability, but provides a pilot for scaling.
- Self-reported data may introduce bias, mitigated by concise, structured questions.
- Time constraints restrict complex interventions, focusing on observational data and general strategies.

## Future Directions
- Expand to larger samples for longitudinal studies or commercial licensing to tech companies.
- Refine strategies based on initial findings for proprietary development by D3velop Ltd.
