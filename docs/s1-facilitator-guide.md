- **Voluntary Participation**: I understand that my participation in Study 1 (e.g., using generic substances like Omega-3, Vitamin D3 + K2, Green Tea Extract, Anthocyanins, Melatonin, as outlined in `study-1-simple-protocol.md`) is entirely voluntary.

I understand the procedures, including completing weekly printable sheets (`study-1-simple-protocol.md`) and reporting data anonymously by default.
- **Risks and Benefits**: I understand there may be minimal risks (e.g., mild adverse reactions to generic substances) and potential benefits (e.g., improved well-being), and I agree to report any issues (e.g., allergies, severe side effects) immediately to [performance@thingylabs.io](mailto:performance@thingylabs.io), per `study-1-facilitator-protocol.md` and exit/abort conditions (Web:0).
- **Data Handling**: I consent to the collection and processing of my data anonymously by default, with optional non-anonymous participation requiring explicit consent.
