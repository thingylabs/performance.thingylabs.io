# Study 1 Facilitator Guide

## Responsibilities
- **Preparation**: Review the [Supplement Protocol](s1-supplement-protocol) to understand the supplements and study goals.
- **Distribution**: Provide participants with the [Participant Guide](s1-participant-guide) and [Daily Tracker](surveys/s1-daily-tracker.md).
- **Monitoring**: Ensure participants log their supplement intake daily and complete end-of-week questions each Sunday.
- **Collection**: Gather completed [Daily Tracker](surveys/s1-daily-tracker) sheets weekly and submit via [survey link or email].
- **Support**: Address participant questions and report issues to [performance@thingylabs.io](mailto:performance@thingylabs.io).

## Procedures
1. **Start-Up**: 
   - Brief participants on the study, emphasizing voluntary participation.
   - Explain the pseudonymous data collection process using participant codes (e.g., TL-202311-123).
   - Ensure participants understand that completing surveys constitutes consent under GDPR.
   - Direct participants to the [GDPR Compliance](/thingylabs-performance-initiative/gdpr-compliance) page.

2. **Weekly Cycle**:
   - Distribute trackers at the week's start.
   - Remind participants to use their unique participant code on all submissions.
   - Remind participants to log daily and complete questions on Sunday.
   - Collect sheets by Monday.

3. **Data Handling**: 
   - Store sheets securely on encrypted servers in compliance with Article 32 GDPR.
   - Maintain pseudonymity by using only participant codes for identification.
   - Ensure no directly identifying information is collected unless explicit consent is given.

## GDPR Considerations
- Remind participants they can exercise their GDPR rights by contacting [performance@thingylabs.io](mailto:performance@thingylabs.io) with their participant code.
- Inform participants that health-related data is being collected as special category data under Article 9 GDPR with their explicit consent.
- Emphasize that participation is voluntary and can be withdrawn at any time.

## Notes
- No specific dosages are mandated—participants choose intake per packaging or preference.
- Contact [performance@thingylabs.io](mailto:performance@thingylabs.io) for assistance or to report adverse reactions.
