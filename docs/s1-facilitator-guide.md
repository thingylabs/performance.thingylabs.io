- **Distribution**: Provide participants with the [Participant Guide](s1-participant-guide.md) and [Daily Tracker](surveys/s1-daily-tracker.md).
- **Monitoring**: Ensure participants log their supplement intake daily and complete end-of-week questions each Sunday.
- **Collection**: Gather completed [Daily Tracker](surveys/s1-daily-tracker.md) sheets weekly and submit via [survey link or email].
- **Support**: Address participant questions and report issues to [performance@thingylabs.io](mailto:performance@thingylabs.io).

2. **Weekly Cycle**:
   - Distribute trackers at the week’s start.
   - Remind participants to log daily and complete questions on Sunday.
   - Collect sheets by Monday.
