# Thingylabs Performance Initiative Study 1 Protocol

## Overview
This protocol (Protocol for Study #1) details the procedures for the scientific investigation of nutritional and physical health strategies to enhance employee physiological and psychological well-being, cognitive performance, and workplace productivity at Thingylabs GmbH, as outlined in Study 1 Outline. The initiative, owned by D3velop Ltd (In Gründung) in Seychelles and licensed to Thingylabs GmbH, adheres to Sports and Nutritional Sciences standards, with plans for additional protocols (e.g., Study 2 Protocol, Study 1.1 Protocol).

## Study Objectives
- Implement and evaluate the impact of nutritional and physical health strategies on employee health, cognitive performance, and productivity.
- Collect and analyze data to test hypotheses linking specific strategies to measurable outcomes, contributing to scientific knowledge and potential commercial applications.

## Nutritional and Physical Health Strategies (Supplements)
We provide the following generic, non-proprietary nutritional and physical health substances/strategies, aligned with Sports and Nutritional Sciences, for employees to use at their discretion:
- **Omega-3 (e.g., Fish Oil Concentrate Softgels)**: Supports energy availability and recovery, with employees choosing intake (less or more than packaging), urged to follow packaging (e.g., Precision Nutrition recommends 3–9 g daily total fish oil, 1–3 g EPA + DHA; see [Precision Nutrition](https://www.precisionnutrition.com/all-about-fish-oil#:~:text=Summary%20and%20recommendations,(e.g.%20herring%2C%20mackerel))) but with choice.
- **Vitamin D3 + K2 (e.g., High-Dose Vegetarian Tablets)**: Enhances recovery and well-being, with employee discretion on intake, urged to follow packaging but with choice.
- **Green Tea Extract (e.g., Capsules with EGCG and Caffeine)**: Supports ergogenic aids and cognitive performance, with employees deciding amounts, urged to follow packaging but with choice.
- **Anthocyanins (e.g., Blueberry Extract Capsules)**: Boosts recovery and well-being, with employee choice on intake, urged to follow packaging but with choice.
- **Melatonin (e.g., Low-Dose Tablets)**: Aids recovery and sleep, with employees choosing amounts, urged to follow packaging (e.g., 0.5 mg per 1/2 tablet) but with choice.

These are generic, ensuring compliance with Germany/EU and Seychelles health regulations, without specific dosages or proprietary products.

## Study Procedures
- **Participant Recruitment**: Recruit Thingylabs GmbH employees (n=2 initially, with potential expansion) on a voluntary basis, providing informed consent under GDPR (anonymous by default, non-anonymous with explicit consent).
- **Intervention**: Participants will adopt the above nutritional and physical health strategies/substances over 12 months, choosing their intake (less or more than packaging, if applicable), urged to follow packaging but with choice, guided by general recommendations (e.g., balanced meals, hydration, recovery practices), without specific dosages or proprietary products.
- **Data Collection**:
  - Use a weekly printable sheet (`study-1-simple-protocol.md`) for daily tracking of substance use (Monday–Sunday) and end-of-week questions on well-being, energy/recovery, productivity, cognitive performance, and sleep.
  - Employees print the sheet weekly, fill out daily for substances (checking boxes and noting custom doses), and complete end-of-week questions on Sunday, using yes/no or 1–5 scales with qualitative feedback (50 chars max).
  - Collect data at 3-month intervals over 12 months (initial, 3-month, 6-month, 9-month, 12-month) by reviewing completed weekly sheets.
- **Data Handling**: Store data anonymously by default, with optional PII stored separately, securely, and deleted 12 months post-study unless otherwise agreed, per GDPR (Web:0).
- **Analysis**: Perform basic statistical analysis (e.g., mean scores, t-tests) for quantitative data and thematic coding for qualitative data, feasible for a small team within time constraints (Web:2).
- **Exit/Abort Conditions**:
  - Participant withdrawal (voluntary or request).
  - Adverse reactions to substances (e.g., allergies, severe side effects).
  - Data quality issues (incomplete, illegible, or unreliable weekly sheets).
  - Regulatory non-compliance (Germany/EU, Seychelles, or GDPR breaches).
  - Safety concerns (new evidence or regulatory changes indicating risks).
  - Study completion (12-month period ends).

## Hypotheses
1. **H1**: Nutritional strategies (e.g., Omega-3, Vitamin D3 + K2, anthocyanins) enhancing energy availability and recovery optimization will significantly improve physiological and psychological well-being (measured via self-reported scales and binary responses).
2. **H2**: Ergogenic aids (e.g., green tea extract) and macronutrient balance (e.g., Omega-3) will significantly enhance cognitive performance and workplace productivity (measured via self-reported scales and binary responses).
3. **H3**: Specific nutritional and physical health strategies (e.g., Omega-3, melatonin) will be identified as primary contributors to observed improvements, based on qualitative feedback.

## Ethical Considerations
- **GDPR Compliance**: Ensure anonymous data collection by default, with optional non-anonymous participation requiring explicit consent. PII is handled securely, stored separately, and deleted 12 months post-study unless otherwise agreed (Web:0).
- **Health Regulations**: Avoid specific dosages or proprietary substances, focusing on generic strategies to comply with German/EU health laws and scientific ethics (Web:3).
- **Informed Consent**: Provide participants with clear information on study purpose, voluntary participation, data use, and exit/abort conditions, per GDPR and ethical standards (Web:1).
- **Exit/Abort Actions**: Suspend participation, notify employees, consult experts (e.g., medical, legal), ensure GDPR compliance (e.g., data deletion), and document reasons for termination or suspension.

## Limitations
- Small sample size (n=2 initially) limits generalizability, but provides a pilot for scaling.
