# Thingylabs Performance Initiative Study 1 Protocol

## Overview
This protocol (Protocol for Study #1) details the procedures for the scientific investigation of nutritional and physical health strategies to enhance employee physiological and psychological well-being, cognitive performance, and workplace productivity at Thingylabs GmbH, as outlined in Study Plan 1. The initiative, owned by D3velop Ltd (In Gründung) in Seychelles and licensed to Thingylabs GmbH, adheres to Sports and Nutritional Sciences standards, with plans for additional protocols (e.g., Study 2 Protocol, Study 1.1 Protocol).

## Study Objectives
- Implement and evaluate the impact of nutritional and physical health strategies on employee health, cognitive performance, and productivity.
- Collect and analyze data to test hypotheses linking specific strategies to measurable outcomes, contributing to scientific knowledge and potential commercial applications.

## Nutritional and Physical Health Strategies (Supplements)
We will test the following generic nutritional and physical health strategies, aligned with Sports and Nutritional Sciences, as the “supplements” or interventions:
- **Energy Availability**: Optimizing the balance between energy intake (e.g., macronutrient balance of carbohydrates, proteins, fats) and expenditure to support physiological well-being and reduce fatigue (Web:1).
- **Ergogenic Aids**: General performance-enhancing nutritional or physical strategies (e.g., hydration, nutrient timing) to improve cognitive performance and productivity, without specifying proprietary substances or dosages (Web:0).
- **Recovery Optimization**: Nutritional strategies (e.g., post-exercise nutrition, micronutrient support) to enhance recovery capacity and psychological well-being (Web:3).
- **Macronutrient Balance**: Adjusting dietary intake of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats to support sustained energy and mental alertness during work hours (Web:1).

These strategies are generic, non-proprietary, and do not include specific dosages or products, ensuring compliance with health regulations and ethical standards in Germany/EU and Seychelles.

## Study Procedures
- **Participant Recruitment**: Recruit Thingylabs GmbH employees (n=2 initially, with potential expansion) on a voluntary basis, providing informed consent under GDPR (anonymous by default, non-anonymous with explicit consent).
- **Intervention**: Participants will adopt the above nutritional and physical health strategies over 12 months, guided by general recommendations (e.g., balanced meals, hydration, recovery practices), without specific dosages or proprietary products.
- **Data Collection**:
  - Use numbered dual-use surveys (e.g., 1-Entry Survey, 2-Follow-Up Survey, 1.1-Interim Survey) for baseline, interim, and longitudinal data on health, performance, and feedback.
  - Each survey includes 5–7 questions, using quantitative scales (1–5) and qualitative responses (50–150 characters) for statistical and thematic analysis (Web:3).
  - Collect data at 3-month intervals over 12 months (initial, 3-month, 6-month, 9-month, 12-month).
- **Data Handling**: Store data anonymously by default, with optional PII stored separately, securely, and deleted 12 months post-study unless otherwise agreed, per GDPR (Web:0).
- **Analysis**: Perform basic statistical analysis (e.g., mean scores, t-tests) for quantitative data and thematic coding for qualitative data, feasible for a small team within time constraints (Web:2).

## Hypotheses
1. **H1**: Nutritional strategies enhancing energy availability and recovery optimization will significantly improve physiological and psychological well-being (measured via self-reported scales and binary responses).
2. **H2**: Ergogenic aids and macronutrient balance will significantly enhance cognitive performance and workplace productivity (measured via self-reported scales and binary responses).
3. **H3**: Specific nutritional and physical health strategies (e.g., energy availability, ergogenic aids) will be identified as primary contributors to observed improvements, based on qualitative feedback.

## Ethical Considerations
- **GDPR Compliance**: Ensure anonymous data collection by default, with optional non-anonymous participation requiring explicit consent. PII is handled securely, stored separately, and deleted 12 months post-study unless otherwise agreed (Web:0).
- **Health Regulations**: Avoid specific dosages or proprietary substances, focusing on generic strategies to comply with German/EU health laws and scientific ethics (Web:3).
- **Informed Consent**: Provide participants with clear information on study purpose, voluntary participation, and data use, per GDPR and ethical standards (Web:1).

## Limitations
- Small sample size (n=2 initially) limits generalizability, but provides a pilot for scaling.
- Self-reported data may introduce bias, mitigated by concise, structured survey questions.
- Time constraints restrict complex interventions, focusing on observational data and general strategies.

## Future Directions
- Expand to larger samples for longitudinal studies or commercial licensing to tech companies.
- Refine strategies based on findings for proprietary development by D3velop Ltd.
